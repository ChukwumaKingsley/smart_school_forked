# smart_school

This is a project on creating a smart automatic grading platform, capable of receiving free response answers of students to questions and scoring those responses. While that is the main feature of this platform, it also has other traditional functionalities of an online student management platform such as student registration, test setting, result review, etc.

This work is in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of some EEE degree to Chukwuma and Okite, students of the Federal University of Technology Owerri.

Cheers!!!
